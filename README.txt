Fetch, Pull, Test, Push, Announce

1. (Click on) Fetch
2. (Click on) Pull (now if anything has been changed by another developer it doesnt get wiped out.)
3. Test (Test if your own code still works and if any errors have popped up.)
4. (If no errors have popped up) Push ( And wait for approval)
5. Announce (that you have made changes so your team can keep that in mind)
